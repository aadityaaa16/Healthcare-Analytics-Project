# ❤️ Heart Disease Analytics – End-to-End Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a complete, end-to-end **HealthCare Data Analytics Pipeline** built using:

- **Python** (EDA + preprocessing)
- **SQL** (data cleaning + transformations)
- **Power BI** (dashboard & DAX)
- **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)

The goal is to analyze and visualize key factors contributing to **heart disease**, identify high-risk patients, and create an interactive analytics dashboard.
